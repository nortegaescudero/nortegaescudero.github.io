<P style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The halo effect is a psychological phenomenon in which positive thoughts about people, people, and events in one society affect how we feel about another society.</P>
<br>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The halo effect often occurs when we consider appearances.
    It is an error in judgment and reflects individual preferences, prejudices and social perception.
    While prejudice can create an impact on an entire group, the halo effect can also be individualized.</p>   
<br>
<p>We can see this trend in all areas of life, from school and work to marketing responses. When negative forces enter our judgments and evaluations, we are unable to think critically about the actions of others. Because of this, some human and material errors are overlooked or ignored. This bias can distort our behavior or cause us to miss important opportunities.
    This can cause another short-term psychological damage: stubbornness. Negative emotions influence our thoughts about people and things, while affirmative emotions keep those thoughts in place. Therefore, we seek information to confirm what we already believe and create space for reflection on our own flawed analyses.</p>

    <br>
<p>Many times, when we demonstrate loyalty to a brand and win a gold medal, it is difficult for us to think about anything else.</p>
<br>
<P>Marketing is where companies can really take advantage of the halo effect. By hiring celebrities to promote their products, they can attract more people who will review the brand. However, not only recognizable faces sell products, but those that are conventionally attractive will also promote flattering judgments about a given item.</P>
